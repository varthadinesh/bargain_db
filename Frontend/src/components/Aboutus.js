            emerged from the desire to breathe new life into unused clothing,
            fostering sustainability in the process. Recognizing the immense
            effort invested by weavers, tailors, and designers in crafting
            outfits, this platform acknowledges the swift turnover of fashion
            trends that often leave these garments barely worn.
